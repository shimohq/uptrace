# Changelog

## v0.2.0

### ðŸ’¡ Enhancements ðŸ’¡

- Added support for exceptions and in-app logs. See
  [Zap](https://github.com/uptrace/opentelemetry-go-extra/tree/main/otelzap) and
  [logrus](https://github.com/uptrace/opentelemetry-go-extra/tree/main/otellogrus) integrations.
- Added services and hostnames overview.
- Added SQL query formatting when viewing spans.
- Require user authentication. Users are defined in the YAML config.
- Added support for having multiple isolated projects in the same database. Projects are defined in
  the YAML config.
- Added ability to filter query results, for example,
  `group by span.group_id | p50(span.duration) | where p50(span.duration) > 10ms`.
- Added `SAMPLE BY` to `spans_index` table.
- Added query limits to `spans_index` queries to better support large datasets.
- Improved error handling on invalid Uptrace queries.
- Use faster and more compact MessagePack encoding to store spans in `spans_data` table.
- Add more attributes to ClickHouse index.

To upgrade, reset ClickHouse schema with the following command (existing data will be lost):

```go
# Using binary
./uptrace --config=/etc/uptrace/uptrace.yml ch reset

# Using sources
go run cmd/uptrace/main.go --config=config/uptrace.yml ch reset
```
